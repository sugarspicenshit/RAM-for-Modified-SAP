# RAM for Modified SAP
Implementation of a 256x8 RAM on a modified SAP computer. (Forgive the spaghetti code, I only modified the code that was given to me)

# How to use on Vivado
Before doing this, I suggest that your local project should have no source codes.

Copy and paste the folder to your local project. Go to Vivado then press `Alt + A`. Go through the wizard then add all the files.

All files in the `sources_1/new` folder are added as **Design Sources**.  
All files in the `sim_1/new` folder are added as **Simulation Sources**.
